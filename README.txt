So you need a Valet.. We've got you covered.

1. To park your diwheel robot run hybrid_astar-diwheel_robot.py
2. To park your car run hybrid_astar.py
3. To park your truck with trailer run hybrid_astar_with_trailer.py

As our valet is quite new and is still learning how to handle different vehicles your
diwheel robot and car should be parked in no time(Approx. 0.107 sec and 0.740 sec respectively)

But our valet struggles with trailer a bit and require around 700-800 secs to 
figure out the optimal path and then proceeds to show you the animation of the
planned trajectory. So please be patient our valet is new but not inexperienced.
Your trailer will be safe!

Do have a look at the requirements.txt file before you try out our valet service!!!
